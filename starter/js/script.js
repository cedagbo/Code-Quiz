// Pseucoding to implement the code quiz
// Create a button that would enable the user to start the game
// Prompt the user for his input
// Link the start button to another html page where we provide different guess options to the user
// Set a time limit that prompts the user for his input
// When the user clicks on the start button, the time should reset
// When a user presses a letter key, the user's guess should be captured as a key event.
// Create a key event that captures the user word guess -> i.e. when the user presses a key
// Initialise the wins counts
// The user wins after guessing all the letters
// A message should appear and the timer should stop
// The corresponding blank "_" should be replaced by the letter
// Initialise the losses counts
// The user looses when the timer runs out before he guesses all the letters
// A message should appear and the timer should stop
// Display the wins and losses status on the screen to enable the user to track his score
// Ensure the score remains the same when the user refreshes the browser page
// Bonus! Add a reset button to sets the wins and losses counts back to zero
